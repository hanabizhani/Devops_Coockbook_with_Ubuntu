1 Installing Git for Linux:	
	- sudo apt-get install git


2 Configuring GitHub:
	- git config --global user.name "user_name"
	- git config --global user.email "email_id"
	
3 Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.So you need to generate SSH key and add it to github settings
	- Generating a new SSH key:
	  * ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
	    > Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/ALGORITHM):[Press enter]
	    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
	    > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
	    
	- Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
	 * eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	 * ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
	 
	- Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
	 * cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
	 
	- Add SSH key to github account
	 * Github account --> settings --> Access --> SSH and GPG keys:
	 * click new SSH key
	 * copy SSH key and save
	 
	- now in terminal:

	If it is asking you for a username and password, your origin remote is pointing at the HTTPS URL rather than the SSH URL.

	Change it to ssh.

	For example, a GitHub project like Git will have an HTTPS URL:

	https://github.com/<Username>/<Project>.git

	And the SSH one:

	git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git

	You can do:

	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git
