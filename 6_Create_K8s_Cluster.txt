Create a k8s cluster with Minikube:
  minikube start --nodes 2 --driver=docker
This command creates 2 node (1worker and 1master) and define docker as a driver (you can also use virtualbox as a driver)
Note: The docker driver should not be used with root privilage.


After successful minikube start, you can check cluster info:
  kubectl cluster-info
  
Also you can debug and diagnose cluster problems with:
  kubectl cluster-info dump
  
Check how many nodes are started and what is the roles:
  kubectl get nodes
  
Now it's time to create a deployment:
  kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
  
Check if you have any pods in your cluster:
  kubectl get pods
You can filter pods information with specific label:
  kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
  
How many deployments do you have on the cluster:
  kubectl get deployments
